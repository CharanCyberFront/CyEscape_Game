# ü§ñ **CyEscape**  
### *An OWASP-Centric Cybersecurity Learning Game*  

## üéØ **Project Overview**  
Our client, **All State Insurance Group**, presented us with an exciting challenge: to develop an engaging game centered on the principles of **OWASP** for their new cybersecurity hires and software developers. For those unfamiliar, OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security Project‚Äîa comprehensive framework guiding the secure development of online applications and addressing the most critical web security vulnerabilities. To meet this challenge, we developed CyEscape: a narrative-rich, 2D game developed on the Unity Game Engine.

## ‚ùó **Problem Statement**  
In cybersecurity education, a major challenge lies in the lack of practical yet engaging learning opportunities as the field continues to evolve. Through our market research, we identified platforms like Hack The Box, PicoCTF, and CyberStart America as leading choices for interactive learning, which provided valuable inspiration for shaping our idea. This challenge is further highlighted by the recent introduction of the Cyber Security Engineering major at Iowa State University, underscoring the growing demand for cybersecurity expertise.

### üîç **Key Challenges We Address**  
- Engagement & Retention
- Lack of Immersion
- Practical Application

## üéÆ **Our Solution: CyEscape**  

- üîê **1. Technical Challenges**
