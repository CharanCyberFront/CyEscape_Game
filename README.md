**CyEscape**
_An OWASP-Centric Cybersecurity Learning Game_

**Project Overview**

Our client, All State Insurance Group, presented us with a challenge: to develop an engaging game centered on the principles of OWASP for their new cybersecurity hires.

For those unfamiliar, OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security Projectâ€”a comprehensive framework guiding the secure development of online applications and addressing the most critical web security vulnerabilities.

To meet this challenge, we developed CyEscape: a narrative-rich, 2D game developed on the Unity Game Engine. Designed to blend storytelling with cybersecurity learning for an immersive educational experience.

**Problem Statement**

In cybersecurity education, a significant challenge is the lack of practical learning opportunities as the field evolves. This issue is further underscored by the recent establishment of the Cyber Security Engineering major at Iowa State University, emphasizing the growing demand for cybersecurity expertise.

Key Challenges We Address:
- Engagement & Retention
- Lack of Immersion
- Practical Application

CyEscape is a game that redefines cybersecurity learning by merging:

Technical Challenges: Each level introduces and explores an OWASP security concept.
Narrative-Driven Gameplay: Every stage is not just a challenge but part of a gripping story that progressively builds towards a climactic showdown.
Engaging Experiences: From missions to epic protagonists, CyEscape provides learners with an immersive, memorable, and educational journey.
By blending practical learning with a captivating narrative, CyEscape aims to enhance engagement and improve retention of technical skills for new cybersecurity professionals.
